Hello, I'm Maycon, a software developer, focused on **Javascript**, **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**, this is where I store my code, from my studies, portfolio projects. I love programming, and being able to work with it is wonderful. I started learning python in early 2020 (I didn't know git), but, researching more about the market, I found that JavaScript dominates the web market, so I've been learning ever since. And it's very interesting to see how much you can do with programming, automating several routines, creating beautiful interfaces, managing databases.

I am open to any opportunity to work with it and, of course, always committed to learning more and more.
