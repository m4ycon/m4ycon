### Hey Vsauce, ops Github, Maycon here!

Hello, I'm Maycon, a software developer, focused on **Javascript**, **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**, this is where I store my code, from my studies, portfolio's projects. I love programming, and being able to work with that it's wonderful. I started learning python in 2020's beginning (I didn't know git), but searching more about the market, I found out that JavaScript dominates the web market, so I've been learning since there. And it's so interesting seeing how much you can do with programming, automating several routines, creating beatiful interfaces, managing data banks.

I'm still beginning searching some opportunity to work with what I love, and continuing commited to learn more and more.
