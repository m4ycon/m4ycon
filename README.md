Hello, I'm Maycon, a software developer, focused on web developing, **Javascript**, **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**, this is where I store my code, from my studies, portfolio projects. I love programming, and being able to work with it is wonderful. I started learning python in early 2020, since there I've been developing my programming skills and understanding more about this universe. And it's very interesting to see how much you can do with programming, automating several routines, creating beautiful interfaces, managing databases.

always a learner.
